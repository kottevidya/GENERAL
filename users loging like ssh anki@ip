How do I add new user accounts with SSH access to my Amazon EC2 Linux instance?

Add a new user to the EC2 Linux instance
1.    Connect to your Linux instance using SSH.
2.    Use the adduser command to add a new user account to an EC2 instance (replace new_user with the new account name). The following example creates an associated group, home directory, and an entry in the /etc/passwd file of the instance:
$ sudo adduser new_user
Note: If you add the new_user to an Ubuntu instance, include the --disabled-password option to avoid adding a password to the new account:
$ sudo adduser new_user --disabled-password
3.    Change the security context to the new_user account so that folders and files you create will have the correct permissions:
$ sudo su - new_user
Note: When you run the sudo su - new_user command, the name at the top of the command shell prompt changes to reflect the new user account context of your shell session.
4.    Create a .ssh directory in the new_user home directory:
mkdir .ssh
5.    Use the chmod command to change the .ssh directory's permissions to 700. Changing the permissions restricts access so that only the new_user can read, write, or open the .ssh directory.
chmod 700 .ssh
6.    Use the touch command to create the authorized_keys file in the .ssh directory:
touch .ssh/authorized_keys
7.    Use the chmod command to change the .ssh/authorized_keys file permissions to 600. Changing the file permissions restricts read or write access to the new_user.
chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
Sudo nano authorized_keys

User Command Logs — AWS Cloudwatch

Ubuntu version 16.04
Modify the /etc/bash.bashrc
Open      sudo nano  /etc/bash.bashrc  file by using any editor, and append the below line at the end of the file
export PROMPT_COMMAND='RETRN_VAL=$?;logger -p local6.debug "$(whoami) [$$]: $(history 1 | sed "s/[ ][0–9]+[ ]//" ) [$RETRN_VAL]"'
PROMPT_COMMAND is an environment variable, The contents of this variable are executed as a regular Bash command just before Bash displays a prompt. by using logger it sends the message into the syslog service by using syslog facility levels ‘local6’ with security level debug.
After this run the following command
# source /etc/bash.bashrc
2. Create a new file /etc/rsyslog.d/bash.conf
Here redirecting the local6 messages from syslog service to /var/log/commands.log file. For that, create the file and add the below line in the bash.conf
local6.* /var/log/commands.log
3. For logrotate, add /var/log/commands.log into  sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog
4. Restart the rsyslog
# service rsyslog restart
How to capture it in Cloud watch
Assign IAM role to the EC2 Instance — AmazonEC2RoleforSSM
To setup an AWS log agent, run the following commands in ubuntu machine
# curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cloudwatch/downloads/latest/awslogs-agent-setup.py -O
# sudo python ./awslogs-agent-setup.py --region 
us-west-2


“or”
# sudo python3 ./awslogs-agent-setup.py --region us-east-1
3. Add commands.log to AWS Logs Agent to sync with CloudWatch
For that, we can edit the file : /var/awslogs/etc/config/command_logs.conf
Add the following lines to this file
 
[ec2-commands-log]
datetime_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
file = /var/log/commands.log
log_stream_name = {instance_id}-commands-log
log_group_name = ec2-commands-log
4. Restart awslogs
#service awslogs restart
